# BSArchive DLL and C++ bindings
BSArchive Dynamic Link Library and C++ bindings

## How to build

1) Create a `XEditPath` environment variable and set it to the directory containing the XEdit code
2) Build the DLL in Delphi by opening the `libbsarch.dproj` project
3) Build the LIB in Visual Studio by opening the `libbsarch.sln` project

## How to use

With CMake: 
Use ``add_subdirectory`` and ``target_link_library``
Then ``#include "libbsarch.h"`` for the C wrapper, or ``#include "bs_archive_auto"`` for the C++ wrapper.
See the example for code use.

Without CMake:
Use `libbsarch.dll` (provided in delphi/lib), `libbsarch.lib` and `libbsarch.h` in your project.
